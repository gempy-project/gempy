        "Main Classes and Objects in GemPy\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" \nGemPy uses Python classes and objects to store and manipulate the data used for modeling. This object-oriented approach helps make\nthe code more modular, reusable, and easier to understand. Each class represents a different aspect of the geological modeling process,\nand objects are instances of these classes that contain specific data and methods to operate on that data.\n\nHere are the main data classes:\n\n-  :obj:`gempy.core.data.GeoModel`\n-  :obj:`gempy.core.data.StructuralFrame`\n-  :obj:`gempy.core.data.StructuralGroup`\n-  :obj:`gempy.core.data.StructuralElement`\n-  :obj:`gempy.core.data.SurfacePointsTable`\n-  :obj:`gempy.core.data.OrientationsTable`\n-  :obj:`gempy.core.data.Grid`\n\n## Setting Up a Model: Initializing Objects and Input Data\nBefore computing a geological model, we need to set up the relevant objects and input data on which the model will be based. Data can \nbe input in various ways. One way is to start from scratch and manually input surface points and orientations. Another way is to import \nexisting data from a file, such as a CSV. Here, we will start with the first method to showcase the essential elements and rules needed \nto build a model in GemPy.\n\n## Starting a Model from Scratch Based on a Cross-Section\nThis first example will be based on a conceptual cross-section that includes data from three boreholes in a line. Let's start by loading \nthe image of this cross-section and plotting it using Matplotlib. For this example, we assume that the size of the image corresponds to \nthe real extent of the data. We will see that extent in the plot and also return it by looking at the shape of the image file:\n\n"

        "OK, so we will base our model creation on this cross-section. Let's get started. To initialize our model, we create a `gempy.Model` object. \nThis object will contain all other data structures and necessary functionality. Here\u2019s what we will do:\n\n1. **Name the Model**: Assign a name to our model.\n\n2. **Define Extent**: Specify the extent in x, y, and z. The extent should make sense depending on your use case and should enclose all \n   relevant data in a representative space. For this example, we align the extent with the cross-section we imported:\n\n    - **X** is parallel to the section.\n    - **Y** is perpendicular. Since we have no data along y, a narrow extent makes sense. We choose an extent of 400, defining it as -200 to 200, \n      placing the cross-section at y=0 (in the middle).\n    - **Z** representing depth, takes a negative value since we are modeling the subsurface.\n\n3. **Initialize Structural Framework**: Set up a default structural framework.\n\n4. **Define either resolution or refinement**: In GemPy 3, you can use either regular grids or octrees.\n    - **Regular grids**: Define a resolution (and refinement=None). A medium resolution of 50x50x50, for example, results in 125,000 voxels.\n      Model voxels are prisms, not cubes, so resolution can differ from extent. Avoid exceeding 100 cells in each direction (1,000,000 voxels)\n      to prevent high computational costs.\n    - **Octrees**: Define a level of refinement (and resolution=None). Higher refinement levels increase computational costs.\n\n.. admonition:: Note on choice of modeling grids \n\n   Which type of grid is used depends on the use case. Note that as of the current version of GemPy 3, \n   the rendering of surfaces uses dual-contouring, which is based on octrees. So even if you choose regular grids, octree-based computing will\n   be executed additionally in order to render the surfaces in 3D.\n\n"

A separate structural element will follow a different isosurface, and once you input additional points and orientations, \nthe scalar field will be altered accordingly.\n\nAs mentioned, each structural group has its own scalar field. These can be combined to achieve more complex structures and relationships, \nas we will see later.\n\nLet's take a look at the current scalar field for our current group by plotting it in 2D.

In this following section,\nwe will exemplify this by creating a random topography grid which allows us to intersect the surfaces as well as compute a high-resolution\ngeological map. GemPy has a built-in function to generate random topography. After executing it, a topography grid will be added to the \n`geo_model`. It can be directly visualized in 2D and 3D.\n\n"

        "## Extracting Model Solutions\nOnce you have built a model, you might not only want to visualize it, but also further analyze it or export it for further utilization. \nFor this, it is good to know that the solutions from modeling are stored in `geo_model.solutions` and can be returned from there. This\nincludes the following outputs in particular:\n- `geo_model.solutions.dc_meshes`: A list of the surface meshes in the model with the location of vertices and edges for each.\n- `geo_model.solutions.raw_arrays`: An object containing numerous arrays that define various parts of the model. Of particular importance\nare the lithology block (`lith_block`), the fault block (`fault_block`), and the scalar field matrix (`scalar_field_matrix`).\n\n## Mesh Solutions\nLet's take a quick look at how we can return some key information from `geo_model.solutions`. Starting with meshes, we can see that the list \n`dc_meshes` can be indexed to return specific meshes and their respective vertices or edges. Please note that the order will be the same as \nin our `structural_frame`, i.e., the index `[0]` will return the first and top surface, in our case, the discontinuity surface.\n\n"
