# Setting Up Our Environment: Importing Libraries

# import GemPy and its GemPy viewer module, which we will be using extensively. Additionally, we will use NumPy for various functions,
# as well as Matplotlib and some of its specific modules/functions for visualizing our data and results in 2D and 3D.

# Main Classes and Objects in GemPy
# """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" 
# GemPy uses Python classes and objects to store and manipulate the data used for modeling. This object-oriented approach helps make
# the code more modular, reusable, and easier to understand. Each class represents a different aspect of the geological modeling process,
# and objects are instances of these classes that contain specific data and methods to operate on that data.
# 
# Here are the main data classes:
# 
# -  :obj:`gempy.core.data.GeoModel`
# -  :obj:`gempy.core.data.StructuralFrame`
# -  :obj:`gempy.core.data.StructuralGroup`
# -  :obj:`gempy.core.data.StructuralElement`
# -  :obj:`gempy.core.data.SurfacePointsTable`
# -  :obj:`gempy.core.data.OrientationsTable`
# -  :obj:`gempy.core.data.Grid`
#
# Setting Up a Model: Initializing Objects and Input Data
# """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
# Before computing a geological model, we need to set up the relevant objects and input data on which the model will be based. Data can 
# be input in various ways. One way is to start from scratch and manually input surface points and orientations. Another way is to import 
# existing data from a file, such as a CSV. Here, we will start with the first method to showcase the essential elements and rules needed 
# to build a model in GemPy.
# 
# Starting a Model from Scratch Based on a Cross-Section
# """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
# This first example will be based on a conceptual cross-section that includes data from three boreholes in a line. Let's start by loading 
# the image of this cross-section and plotting it using Matplotlib. For this example, we assume that the size of the image corresponds to 
# the real extent of the data. We will see that extent in the plot and also return it by looking at the shape of the image file:

# %%
img = mpimg.imread('boreholes_concept.png')
plt.imshow(img, origin='upper', alpha=.8)
img.shape[:2]
# %% md
# OK, so we will base our model creation on this cross-section. Let's get started. To initialize our model, we create a `gempy.Model` object. 
# This object will contain all other data structures and necessary functionality. Hereâ€™s what we will do:
# 
# 1. **Name the Model**: Assign a name to our model.
#
# 2. **Define Extent**: Specify the extent in x, y, and z. The extent should make sense depending on your use case and should enclose all 
#    relevant data in a representative space. For this example, we align the extent with the cross-section we imported:
#
#     - **X** is parallel to the section.
#     - **Y** is perpendicular. Since we have no data along y, a narrow extent makes sense. We choose an extent of 400, defining it as -200 to 200, 
#       placing the cross-section at y=0 (in the middle).
#     - **Z** representing depth, takes a negative value since we are modeling the subsurface.
#
# 3. **Initialize Structural Framework**: Set up a default structural framework.
#
# 4. **Define either resolution or refinement**: In GemPy 3, you can use either regular grids or octrees.
#     - **Regular grids**: Define a resolution (and refinement=None). A medium resolution of 50x50x50, for example, results in 125,000 voxels.
#       Model voxels are prisms, not cubes, so resolution can differ from extent. Avoid exceeding 100 cells in each direction (1,000,000 voxels)
#       to prevent high computational costs.
#     - **Octrees**: Define a level of refinement (and resolution=None). Higher refinement levels increase computational costs.
#
# .. admonition:: Note on choice of modeling grids 
#
#    Which type of grid is used depends on the use case. Note that as of the current version of GemPy 3, 
#    the rendering of surfaces uses dual-contouring, which is based on octrees. So even if you choose regular grids, octree-based computing will
#    be executed additionally in order to render the surfaces in 3D.

# %%
geo_model = gp.create_geomodel(
    project_name='Model1',
    extent=[0, 780, -200, 200, -582, 0],
    resolution=(50, 50, 50),
    # refinement=4, # We will use octrees
    structural_frame=gp.data.StructuralFrame.initialize_default_structure()
)
# %% md
# The `geo_model` Object
# """"""""""""""""""""""
# The :obj:`gempy.core.data.GeoModel` object we just initialized contains all the essential information for constructing our model, 
# such as the parameters defined above,
# and the input data we will introduce further below. You can access different types of information by accessing the attributes. For instance, you
# can retrieve the coordinates of our modeling grid as follows:

# %%
geo_model.grid

# %% md
# The `geo_model` object also contains the structural frame of our model, i.e., information about our main structural groups (also referred to as
# series or stacks in our model), and their sequential and geological relationships with one another. Each group can contain several elements,
# which can be surfaces representing the **bottom** interfaces of lithological units or fault planes. Each structural group also has a relation
# type that defines the relation of the structural elements to others. The relation type is 'erode' by default but can also be 'onlap' or 'fault' 
# (more about this later). The structural frame also contains information about fault relationships, i.e., which elements are affected by which 
# faults. Let's look at our default structural frame:

# %%
geo_model.structural_frame

# %% md
# As you can see, by default, there is one element called 'surface 1' and no faults. However, by default, GemPy actually not only starts off 
# with this 'surface 1' but also a 'basement' unit which is always present. We can see this using the following function:

# %%
geo_model.structural_frame.structural_elements

# %% md
# We can also rename our structural elements and assign colors as needed. This will later become relevant for the legend in our plots of the
# data and generated model. Let's assume we already know our uppermost surface, 'surface 1,' is a limestone unit. Let's also ensure it is
# represented by the same color as displayed in the cross-section. For this, we input hex color codes.

# %%
geo_model.structural_frame.structural_elements[0].color = '#33ABFF'  # Set 'surface 1' color to blue.
geo_model.structural_frame.structural_elements[1].color = '#570987'  # Set basement color to purple.

geo_model.structural_frame.structural_elements[0].name = 'Limestone'  # Renaming 'surface 1' to 'Limestone'.
geo_model.structural_frame.structural_elements[0]

# %%
geo_model.structural_frame.structural_groups[0].name = 'Deposit. Series'

# %% md
# Manually Inputting Data
# """""""""""""""""""""""
# Now that the `geo_model` object has been created and our first structural element renamed, we can start inputting data by reading it from
# the cross-section. We start with location points that represent the boundaries between two lithological units. Let's look at the cross-section 
# again. This time we use a `gempy_viewer` function to create a plot that can include the cross-section image, as well as data in the object 
# `geo_model` - which is for now empty but we will start adding data next. Let's also add a grid to better read the location of points.
# 
# The image cross-section indicates that there are three lithological boundaries, with one dot for each boundary shown in the first two boreholes.
# The third borehole doesn't go as deep and only provides one dot, i.e., information about the first boundary. These dots represent the location
# of a boundary surface in depth. Remember also that in GemPy, each surface represents the bottom of the unit it is assigned to.

# Looking at the plot, we can read the location of the surface points and start adding them to our `geo_model` object. For now, let's focus on 
# only the uppermost layer, the limestone, with its bottom boundary represented by the blue dots. Using the function `add_surface_points`, 
# we can start adding the positional points to our `geo_model` object. Let's start with only one. From looking at the plot, the first blue
# point seems to be located at approximately 250 in the x direction and around 95 meters in depth. Since we assume the section to be at y=0,

# Minimum Data for Model Computation
# """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
# Ok, good! Now we have added the position of the bottom of this top layer for each borehole. But is this enough to compute our first layer? 
# Well, no. GemPy's approach is based on an implicit interpolation method that requires the following minimum data:
#
#  - **Two surface points** for at least one surface in a structural group/series
#  - **One orientation** per structural group/series
# 
# Thanks to GemPy's global interpolation approach, once you have one surface defined by two surface points and an orientation in a structural 
# group, you can add more surfaces (in the same group) with the minimum of one surface point, as it will now take its orientation information
# from the other surface.
# 
# So, we are missing an orientation. Let's go ahead and add one. It seems that we can assume a horizontal orientation between the first two 
# surface points (apparent, as we have no information about the y-direction). Let's add a corresponding orientation using the function 
# `add_orientations`:

# %%

# You can see how the computed interface runs through the points we defined and is furthermore determined by the one orientation we placed.
# Now, let's look at our 3D model:

# %%
# 3D visualization:
gpv.plot_3d(geo_model, show_surfaces=True, image=False)

# %% md
# Very good, we have successfully computed the first iteration of our model including one lithological interface. You could now go ahead and
# fine-tune the model by adding further points or orientations. For now, let's continue.
# 
# About Scalar Fields
# """""""""""""""""""
# GemPy's global interpolation approach uses scalar fields to compute models. Each structural group or series has its own scalar field, which
# is defined by the data input to all of its elements and at least the minimum data mentioned above. Given that alone, a scalar field will 
# already be created "globally", i.e., for the full extent of the modeling space. The defined surface follows one value along that field as
# an isosurface. A separate structural element will follow a different isosurface, and once you input additional points and orientations, 
# the scalar field will be altered accordingly.
# 
# As mentioned, each structural group has its own scalar field. These can be combined to achieve more complex structures and relationships, 
# as we will see later.
# 
# Let's take a look at the current scalar field for our current group by plotting it in 2D. Keep it in mind as we go ahead and add additional
# elements and data.

# Adding a Second Lithological Unit
# """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
# To add another unit to our model, we can define it as another structural element and then append it to our `geo_model` object. We do this
# for the second unit in the following steps. See how we can already give it a name (let's assume this is a siltstone now), a color corresponding 
# to the dot colors in the cross-section, as well as define surface points and orientations. By appending it to `structural_groups[0]`, we are
# adding it to our first (and currently only) structural group/series, i.e., it will be in the same stack as our limestone.

# %%

# Now, we can see that this siltstone unit is part of our structural frame. Note below, that it has by default been added below the limestone. 
# The order of structural elements within one group only affects the default color assigned. We recommend being consistent in the way you 
# choose to order them, and to order them in accordance with geological age. The order of structural groups actually represents geological 
# time relationships, with groups at the top being the youngest and lower ones being older. This, together with their `StackRelationType`,

# Discontinuities: Combining Scalar Fields

# of their scalar fields. In the following part, we will look at the right side of our cross-section, where we only have limited data, and
# see how we can add a new structural group to create various types of discontinuities, and with that, possibly even meaningful alternative 
# model hypotheses.

# Topography and Geological Maps
# """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
# In GemPy, we can add more grid types for different purposes, such as to add topography to our model. In this following section,
# we will exemplify this by creating a random topography grid which allows us to intersect the surfaces as well as compute a high-resolution
# geological map. GemPy has a built-in function to generate random topography. After executing it, a topography grid will be added to the 
# `geo_model`. It can be directly visualized in 2D and 3D.

# %%
# GemPy offers built-in tools to manage topographic data through gdal.
# For demonstration, we'll create a random topography:

gp.set_topography_from_random(
    grid=geo_model.grid,
    fractal_dimension=1.9,
    d_z=np.array([-150, 0]),
    topography_resolution=np.array([200, 200])
)
# %%
gpv.plot_2d(geo_model, show_topography=True)

# %%
gpv.plot_3d(geo_model, show_surfaces=True, image=False, show_topography=True, show_lith=False)

# %% md
# If we now also re-compute our geological model, the generated topography grid will display the lithological units that intersect it, 
# i.e., which outcrop at the surface. We can therefore display a geological map based on our topography and the underlying 3D geological model. 
# To plot a top-down view of this map, you can pass the arguments `section_names=['topography']` and `show_topography=True` in the plotting
# function as shown below.

# %%
gp.compute_model(geo_model)

# %%
gpv.plot_2d(geo_model, section_names=['topography'], show_topography=True)

# %%
gpv.plot_3d(geo_model, show_surfaces=True, image=False, show_topography=True)

# %% md
# We can now see how the topography displays the color of the lithologies outcropping at the surface, together with topographical contour lines.
# 
# While this topography is random, GemPy also has the capability to include real topography files and arrays via the functions 
# `set_topography_from_file` and `set_topography_from_arrays`.

# %% md
# Extracting Model Solutions
# """"""""""""""""""""""""""
# Once you have built a model, you might not only want to visualize it, but also further analyze it or export it for further utilization. 
# For this, it is good to know that the solutions from modeling are stored in `geo_model.solutions` and can be returned from there. This
# includes the following outputs in particular:
# - `geo_model.solutions.dc_meshes`: A list of the surface meshes in the model with the location of vertices and edges for each.
# - `geo_model.solutions.raw_arrays`: An object containing numerous arrays that define various parts of the model. Of particular importance
# are the lithology block (`lith_block`), the fault block (`fault_block`), and the scalar field matrix (`scalar_field_matrix`).
# 
# Mesh Solutions
# """"""""""""""
# Let's take a quick look at how we can return some key information from `geo_model.solutions`. Starting with meshes, we can see that the list 
# `dc_meshes` can be indexed to return specific meshes and their respective vertices or edges. Please note that the order will be the same as 
# in our `structural_frame`, i.e., the index `[0]` will return the first and top surface, in our case, the discontinuity surface.

# %%
vertices_0 = geo_model.solutions.dc_meshes[0].vertices
edges_0 = geo_model.solutions.dc_meshes[0].edges
print(type(vertices_0), vertices_0, edges_0)

# %% md
# We can see that the vertices for this mesh were returned as a Numpy array with values for *x*, *y*, and *z* positions for each vertex. 
# However, the values don't correspond with our model extent. That is because they have been transformed in GemPy. To return the values
# corresponding to the original coordinate system, we can invert this transformation as follows:

# %%
geo_model.input_transform.apply_inverse(vertices_0)

# %% md
# Lithology Block
# """""""""""""""
# The lithology block is an array that, for a given model realization/solution, returns the ID of the lithology for each voxel. Note below
# that the `lith_block` first returns all values in the shape of one row. You might need to reshape it as shown below. For a regular grid,
# you can reshape it using the resolution used in `geo_model`.
# 

# %%
lith_block = geo_model.solutions.raw_arrays.lith_block
print(lith_block.shape, lith_block)

# %%
lith_block = lith_block.reshape(50, 50, 50)
print(lith_block.shape, lith_block)

# %% md
# Grid Values
# """""""""""
# Apart from these solutions, you might also need to return grid values. You can access the values for each grid in your `geo_model` 
# object via `geo_model.grid` as shown below.
# %%
geo_model.grid.regular_grid.values
# %%
geo_model.grid.topography.values
