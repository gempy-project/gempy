Getting Started
===============

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 8-24

Welcome to our introductory notebook on GemPy! Here, we will cover the essentials of GemPy, introducing you to the core concepts of
geomodeling and demonstrating how you can leverage these to create your own geological models. We will guide you through building a
model from scratch, based on a conceptual 2D cross-section with boreholes. This simple example will highlight key workflow steps 
and structural features that GemPy can model.

Installation

Setting Up Our Environment: Importing Libraries
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To work with Python packages in our notebook, we need to import them first. Let's start with that. In the following cell, we will
import GemPy and its GemPy viewer module, which we will be using extensively. Additionally, we will use NumPy for various functions,
as well as Matplotlib and some of its specific modules/functions for visualizing our data and results in 2D and 3D.

Main Classes and Objects in GemPy
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" 
GemPy uses Python classes and objects to store and manipulate the data used for modeling. This object-oriented approach helps make
the code more modular, reusable, and easier to understand. Each class represents a different aspect of the geological modeling process,
and objects are instances of these classes that contain specific data and methods to operate on that data.

Here are the main data classes:

-  :obj:`gempy.core.data.GeoModel`
-  :obj:`gempy.core.data.StructuralFrame`
-  :obj:`gempy.core.data.StructuralGroup`
-  :obj:`gempy.core.data.StructuralElement`
-  :obj:`gempy.core.data.SurfacePointsTable`
-  :obj:`gempy.core.data.OrientationsTable`
-  :obj:`gempy.core.data.Grid`

Setting Up a Model: Initializing Objects and Input Data
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Before computing a geological model, we need to set up the relevant objects and input data on which the model will be based. Data can 
be input in various ways. One way is to start from scratch and manually input surface points and orientations. Another way is to import 
existing data from a file, such as a CSV. Here, we will start with the first method to showcase the essential elements and rules needed 
to build a model in GemPy.

Starting a Model from Scratch Based on a Cross-Section
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This first example will be based on a conceptual cross-section that includes data from three boreholes in a line. Let's start by loading 
the image of this cross-section and plotting it using Matplotlib. For this example, we assume that the size of the image corresponds to 
the real extent of the data. We will see that extent in the plot and also return it by looking at the shape of the image file:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 73-76

.. code-block:: Python

    img = mpimg.imread('boreholes_concept.png')
    plt.imshow(img, origin='upper', alpha=.8)

OK, so we will base our model creation on this cross-section. Let's get started. To initialize our model, we create a `gempy.Model` object. 
This object will contain all other data structures and necessary functionality. Here’s what we will do:

1. **Name the Model**: Assign a name to our model.

2. **Define Extent**: Specify the extent in x, y, and z. The extent should make sense depending on your use case and should enclose all 
   relevant data in a representative space. For this example, we align the extent with the cross-section we imported:

    - **X** is parallel to the section.
    - **Y** is perpendicular. Since we have no data along y, a narrow extent makes sense. We choose an extent of 400, defining it as -200 to 200, 
      placing the cross-section at y=0 (in the middle).
    - **Z** representing depth, takes a negative value since we are modeling the subsurface.

3. **Initialize Structural Framework**: Set up a default structural framework.

4. **Define either resolution or refinement**: In GemPy 3, you can use either regular grids or octrees.
    - **Regular grids**: Define a resolution (and refinement=None). A medium resolution of 50x50x50, for example, results in 125,000 voxels.
      Model voxels are prisms, not cubes, so resolution can differ from extent. Avoid exceeding 100 cells in each direction (1,000,000 voxels)
      to prevent high computational costs.
    - **Octrees**: Define a level of refinement (and resolution=None). Higher refinement levels increase computational costs.

.. admonition:: Note on choice of modeling grids 

   Which type of grid is used depends on the use case. Note that as of the current version of GemPy 3, 
   the rendering of surfaces uses dual-contouring, which is based on octrees. So even if you choose regular grids, octree-based computing will
   be executed additionally in order to render the surfaces in 3D.

The `geo_model` Object
""""""""""""""""""""""
The :obj:`gempy.core.data.GeoModel` object we just initialized contains all the essential information for constructing our model, 
such as the parameters defined above,
and the input data we will introduce further below. You can access different types of information by accessing the attributes. For instance, you
can retrieve the coordinates of our modeling grid as follows:

The `geo_model` object also contains the structural frame of our model, i.e., information about our main structural groups (also referred to as
series or stacks in our model), and their sequential and geological relationships with one another. Each group can contain several elements,
which can be surfaces representing the **bottom** interfaces of lithological units or fault planes. Each structural group also has a relation
type that defines the relation of the structural elements to others. The relation type is 'erode' by default but can also be 'onlap' or 'fault' 
(more about this later). The structural frame also contains information about fault relationships, i.e., which elements are affected by which 
faults. Let's look at our default structural frame:

As you can see, by default, there is one element called 'surface 1' and no faults. However, by default, GemPy actually not only starts off 
with this 'surface 1' but also a 'basement' unit which is always present. We can see this using the following function:

    )]

We can also rename our structural elements and assign colors as needed. This will later become relevant for the legend in our plots of the
data and generated model. Let's assume we already know our uppermost surface, 'surface 1,' is a limestone unit. Let's also ensure it is
represented by the same color as displayed in the cross-section. For this, we input hex color codes.

Manually Inputting Data
"""""""""""""""""""""""
Now that the `geo_model` object has been created and our first structural element renamed, we can start inputting data by reading it from
the cross-section. We start with location points that represent the boundaries between two lithological units. Let's look at the cross-section 
again. This time we use a `gempy_viewer` function to create a plot that can include the cross-section image, as well as data in the object 
`geo_model` - which is for now empty but we will start adding data next. Let's also add a grid to better read the location of points.

The image cross-section indicates that there are three lithological boundaries, with one dot for each boundary shown in the first two boreholes.
The third borehole doesn't go as deep and only provides one dot, i.e., information about the first boundary. These dots represent the location
of a boundary surface in depth. Remember also that in GemPy, each surface represents the bottom of the unit it is assigned to.

Looking at the plot, we can read the location of the surface points and start adding them to our `geo_model` object. For now, let's focus on 
only the uppermost layer, the limestone, with its bottom boundary represented by the blue dots. Using the function `add_surface_points`, 
we can start adding the positional points to our `geo_model` object. Let's start with only one. From looking at the plot, the first blue
point seems to be located at approximately 250 in the x direction and around 95 meters in depth. Since we assume the section to be at y=0,
we can leave y as 0. We can input that as follows:

Minimum Data for Model Computation
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Ok, good! Now we have added the position of the bottom of this top layer for each borehole. But is this enough to compute our first layer? 
Well, no. GemPy's approach is based on an implicit interpolation method that requires the following minimum data:

 - **Two surface points** for at least one surface in a structural group/series
 - **One orientation** per structural group/series

Thanks to GemPy's global interpolation approach, once you have one surface defined by two surface points and an orientation in a structural 
group, you can add more surfaces (in the same group) with the minimum of one surface point, as it will now take its orientation information
from the other surface.

So, we are missing an orientation. Let's go ahead and add one. It seems that we can assume a horizontal orientation between the first two 
surface points (apparent, as we have no information about the y-direction). Let's add a corresponding orientation using the function 
`add_orientations`:

Very good, we have successfully computed the first iteration of our model including one lithological interface. You could now go ahead and
fine-tune the model by adding further points or orientations. For now, let's continue.

About Scalar Fields
"""""""""""""""""""
GemPy's global interpolation approach uses scalar fields to compute models. Each structural group or series has its own scalar field, which
is defined by the data input to all of its elements and at least the minimum data mentioned above. Given that alone, a scalar field will 
already be created "globally", i.e., for the full extent of the modeling space. The defined surface follows one value along that field as
an isosurface. A separate structural element will follow a different isosurface, and once you input additional points and orientations, 
the scalar field will be altered accordingly.

As mentioned, each structural group has its own scalar field. These can be combined to achieve more complex structures and relationships, 
as we will see later.

Let's take a look at the current scalar field for our current group by plotting it in 2D. Keep it in mind as we go ahead and add additional
elements and data.

Adding a Second Lithological Unit
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
To add another unit to our model, we can define it as another structural element and then append it to our `geo_model` object. We do this
for the second unit in the following steps. See how we can already give it a name (let's assume this is a siltstone now), a color corresponding 
to the dot colors in the cross-section, as well as define surface points and orientations. By appending it to `structural_groups[0]`, we are
adding it to our first (and currently only) structural group/series, i.e., it will be in the same stack as our limestone.

Now, we can see that this siltstone unit is part of our structural frame. Note below, that it has by default been added below the limestone. 
The order of structural elements within one group only affects the default color assigned. We recommend being consistent in the way you 
choose to order them, and to order them in accordance with geological age. The order of structural groups actually represents geological 
time relationships, with groups at the top being the youngest and lower ones being older. This, together with their `StackRelationType`, 
decides how they affect each other via their individual scalar fields, as we will see later.

The 2D visualization of our updated model now shows that the next surface follows the respective point we added. Based on the implicit
modeling approach GemPy uses, given this sparse information we have put in, the siltstone bottom interface otherwise follows the course 
and orientation of the limestone we defined earlier. This is due to the scalar field which was defined by the data input for the structural
group as a whole. In our 2D plot, we can see that this fits quite well with the first borehole, too. Still, let's add the remaining point,
and while we are at it, let's also add the third lithological unit marked in green.

Discontinuities: Combining Scalar Fields
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Now that we have created all the lithological units and added all the surface points we got from the boreholes, we have created a very
simple geological model. However, geological scenarios are usually more complex. In GemPy, you can not only combine numerous surface
points and orientations to create elaborate structures but also create various structural groups that affect each other through combinations
of their scalar fields. In the following part, we will look at the right side of our cross-section, where we only have limited data, and
see how we can add a new structural group to create various types of discontinuities, and with that, possibly even meaningful alternative 
model hypotheses.

So, let's define another structural element that will serve to showcase the different types of discontinuities we can implement in GemPy:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 466-486

    element_discont = gp.data.StructuralElement(
        name='Discont_Surface',

        surface_points=gp.data.SurfacePointsTable.from_arrays(
            x=np.array([550, 650]),
            y=np.array([0, 0]),
            z=np.array([-30, -200]),
            names='Discont_Surface'
        ),
        orientations=gp.data.OrientationsTable.from_arrays(
            x=np.array([600]),
            y=np.array([0]),
            z=np.array([-100]),

        )
    )

To place the discontinuity element in a separate structural group, we need to create one. This is what we do next. Note that we directly 
add the element to the group as we create it, and we define the group's structural relation type as the default 'erode'. We can then insert
the group into the structural frame.

We now have two very different scalar fields. Note how they are each defined by the input data assigned to their respective structural 
elements. Multiple scalar fields in GemPy influence each other depending on (1) their order and (2) their `StackRelationType`. The latter 
defines how a younger (upper) structural group will relate to the older (lower) structural groups and possibly affect their scalar field.

The parameter `StackRelationType` can take the following values:

- `BASEMENT`: Treats all lower groups as the basement.
- `ERODE`: Defines erosive contact/unconformity.
- `ONLAP`: Defines the younger group to be onlapping onto the older groups.
- `FAULT`: Defines the group to be a fault.

We will now take a look at each of these relation types except for the basement type.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 552-556

Erosive Contact
"""""""""""""""
For this, we don't have to change anything now, as we already set the `StackRelationType` to be `ERODE`. If we now plot it, we will see 
how this younger structural group erodes all older elements and basically "cuts them out" in our model.

We can see how all units of the depositional series stop at the contact with the new discontinuity group. However, this doesn't look 
quite right, and it in particular doesn't fit the surface point that was observed in the third borehole. So let's try another relation type.

Onlapping

In the 2D and 3D visualizations, we can now see how the insertion of a fault has created a viable alternative hypothesis that fits the 
original data in the cross-section. Instead of a larger syncline structure and upward-bending of the whole depositional series, we can 
now explain the shallower depth of the limestone in the third borehole by the effects of a reverse fault. In this model realization,
all lithological units are oriented near-horizontal but are offset by the fault. Note that in GemPy, the degree of offset is defined 
by the location of the surface points on each side. If there is no data on one side of a fault, a very large offset will be assumed.

Note also that by implementing a fault, the scalar field of the depositional series has been affected by the offset.

Topography and Geological Maps
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
In GemPy, we can add more grid types for different purposes, such as to add topography to our model. In this following section,
we will exemplify this by creating a random topography grid which allows us to intersect the surfaces as well as compute a high-resolution
geological map. GemPy has a built-in function to generate random topography. After executing it, a topography grid will be added to the 
`geo_model`. It can be directly visualized in 2D and 3D.

If we now also re-compute our geological model, the generated topography grid will display the lithological units that intersect it, 
i.e., which outcrop at the surface. We can therefore display a geological map based on our topography and the underlying 3D geological model. 
To plot a top-down view of this map, you can pass the arguments `section_names=['topography']` and `show_topography=True` in the plotting
function as shown below.

While this topography is random, GemPy also has the capability to include real topography files and arrays via the functions

Extracting Model Solutions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Once you have built a model, you might not only want to visualize it, but also further analyze it or export it for further utilization. 
For this, it is good to know that the solutions from modeling are stored in `geo_model.solutions` and can be returned from there. This
includes the following outputs in particular:
- `geo_model.solutions.dc_meshes`: A list of the surface meshes in the model with the location of vertices and edges for each.
- `geo_model.solutions.raw_arrays`: An object containing numerous arrays that define various parts of the model. Of particular importance
are the lithology block (`lith_block`), the fault block (`fault_block`), and the scalar field matrix (`scalar_field_matrix`).

Mesh Solutions
""""""""""""""
Let's take a quick look at how we can return some key information from `geo_model.solutions`. Starting with meshes, we can see that the list 
`dc_meshes` can be indexed to return specific meshes and their respective vertices or edges. Please note that the order will be the same as 
in our `structural_frame`, i.e., the index `[0]` will return the first and top surface, in our case, the discontinuity surface.

We can see that the vertices for this mesh were returned as a Numpy array with values for *x*, *y*, and *z* positions for each vertex. 
However, the values don't correspond with our model extent. That is because they have been transformed in GemPy. To return the values
corresponding to the original coordinate system, we can invert this transformation as follows:
