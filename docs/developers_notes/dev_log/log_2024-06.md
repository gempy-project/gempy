# Refactoring grid to add transform

## TODO:
- [x] Rotation of pyvista grid
- [x] Rotation of pyvista meshes
- [ ] Run something with octrees again
- [ ] **We do need settings presets**


## Release Notes:
- (Beta) Pivot grids 
- Analysis tools: 
  - Eigenvalues and condition numbers
  - Transformed data plots
  - Octree refinement evaluation
- Improved octree testing
- LiquidEarth integration
- Chunking for large grids
 
## Notes:
### Optimizing interpolation June 2024

- Create_grad_kernel is call 27 times

### Wholes issue
- Spremberg with 1.5 std of extra refinement:
      Number of voxels marked by stats: 424 of torch.Size([512]).
      Number of voxels marked total by corners: 281
      Dense Grid would be 512 voxels
      Number of voxels marked by stats: 2535 of torch.Size([3568]).
      Number of voxels marked total by corners: 1492
      Dense Grid would be 4096 voxels
      Number of voxels marked by stats: 12148 of torch.Size([21152]).
      Number of voxels marked total by corners: 7614
      Dense Grid would be 32768 voxels
      Number of voxels marked by stats: 69619 of torch.Size([101432]).
      Number of voxels marked total by corners: 37423
      Dense Grid would be 262144 voxels
      Chunking done: 12 chunks
